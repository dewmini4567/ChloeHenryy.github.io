<p>La<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008080;"><em><strong>Interest in IT?</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My interest in IT began relatively late into my last year of high-school, due to changing friendship groups I became surrounded with people who had a passion for IT and gaming, which influenced my own passion for IT through constant exposure to it, and a fascination for how the internet, hardware, and software all works together in order to perform certain functions. In year 12, many of my friends were taking IT electives at school whilst I had predominately humanity-based subjects, a choice which I grew to regret later on into my last year of schooling, as my friends would talk about setting up their own websites and creating their own codes using java, python, etc. Whilst I didn&rsquo;t understand any of it, I was eager to learn and build upon the little IT knowledge I had gained from listening to my friends discuss their technology electives. That is why I chose to enroll in Bachelor of Technology (computing studies); in order to build upon my knowledge of Information Technology.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008080;"><em><strong>Why did you chose to come to RMIT?</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I chose to come to RMIT as I had heard many positive things about the University (both online and from friends), and attended one of the orientation days in early 2018. I was impressed with the buildings on campus and the sense of community that RMIT appears to have. RMIT also offered an IT course which did not require units 3&amp;4 of any math, as I dropped general math at the end of year 11 due to my pure dislike of the subject; I limited the amount of courses I could apply for unfortunately. The RMIT campus is also a in a convenient spot, making it easier for me to travel back and forth from university multiple times per week. However, I believe I&rsquo;ve made the best choice in attending RMIT University.</p>nguages spoken: English, Basic German.</p>
